# Bluetooth Capture Files
This directory has several Bluetooth Capture files and details on how to create them. 
The files with extension pcappng were created using Wireshark. 
The files ending in _hci.log were created on an android device with "Enable Bluetoopth HCI snoop log" turned on.
Wireshark is the program I'm using to interpret each type of file.

I've recently found that the most reliable way to get the log from the android device to the PC for debugging is to use gmail on the android device to email the log to myself as an atachment.
